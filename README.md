# Optimised Ensemble Classifier

This code is for a new ensemble classifier. The new ensemble is based on clustering of input data space, optimising clusters and base-classifiers and finally fusing the optimised base-classifiers. The ensemble uses many types of base classifiers and particle swarm optimisation. It can automatically generate the best ensemble classifier.
All steps for creating your own data file and running the ensemble program are shown in README_HowtoCreateOwnDataFile.txt
